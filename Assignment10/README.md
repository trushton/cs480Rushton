Objective:
---------
The purpose of this assignment is to create a program that applies 4 lighting types to a single model. To accomplish this you will be using shaders and the Phong Model to apply the correct lighting.

Implement a program that applies all 4 light types and allows each to be toggleable.
Ambient
Distant
Point
Spot


To Compile the Program:
----------------------
1) Open a terminal and change to the assignment folder.
2) Navigate to the "build" folder. (cd build)
3) Once in build, simply type "make".


To Run the Program:
------------------
1) Navigate to the "bin" folder. (cd ../bin)
2) Once in bin, simply type "./Matrix
3) The program should now be running.


Controls:
--------
	Keyboard:

		The model can be rotated using the arrow keys.

		1 - Toggle ambient light on/off.
		2 - Toggle diffuse light on/off.
		3 - Toggle specular light on/off.
		4 - Toggle pointlight on/off.
		5 - Toggle spotlight on/off.

		s - Toggle between per vertex and per fragment shading.


Extra Credit:
------------
Implemented per fragment and per vertex shading and created a toggle button ('s') to switch between them.
